# Hi, I'm Jack!

Hello and welcome to my learning journal. I am preparing myself to begin my journey in programming. I will be chronicling my journey to *CODE MASTER!!* here and maintaining a growth mindset throughout the journey. Three key ideas that drive me at this point are:

  1. I Can't Do This...YET
  2. The Obstacle Becomes The Way
  3. Thought Loops. Drive Out The Negative With Positive Thought Loops.
