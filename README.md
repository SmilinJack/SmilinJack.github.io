# Hi, I'm [Jack](https://github.com/SmilinJack)!

Welcome to my learning journal. I'm a retired US Army Noncommissioned Officer. As I begin my journey in programming I will be chronicling some elements here. While I make this transition in career fields I will strive to stay focused on a growth mindset throughout. A growth mindset is one that fuels progress by remaining positive, being solution oriented, and with the humility to ask for help when stuck or faced with something new. A growth mindset is sign of ambition and motivation. It is a natural result of a desire to learn and discover.

**Epictetus** advises us:
>Progress is not achieved by luck or accident, but by working on yourself daily

Three key ideas that drive me at this point are:

  1. I Can't Do This...YET
  2. The Obstacle Becomes The Way
  3. Thought Loops. Drive Out The Negative With Positive Thought Loops.

## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs
A **text editor** kind of gives away what it does in the title — it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful.

An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. [source](https://medium.com/@theoldercoder/choosing-a-text-editor-3e56f71bd636)
