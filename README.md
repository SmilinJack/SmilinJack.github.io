# Hi, I'm Jack!

Welcome to my learning journal. As I begin my journey in programming, I will be chronicling some elements here while staying focused on a growth mindset throughout. Three key ideas that drive me at this point are:

  1. I Can't Do This...YET
  2. The Obstacle Becomes The Way
  3. Thought Loops. Drive Out The Negative With Positive Thought Loops.
