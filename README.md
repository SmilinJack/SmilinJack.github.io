# Hi, I'm Jack!

Welcome to my learning journal. I'm a retired US Army Soldier. As I begin my journey in programming I will be chronicling some elements here. While I make this transition in career fields I will strive to stay focused on a growth mindset throughout. A growth mindset is one that fuels progress by remaining positive, being solution oriented, and with the humility to ask for help when stuck or faced with something new. A growth mindset is sign of ambition and motivation. It is a natural result of a desire to learn and discover. **Epictetus** advises us:
>Progress is not achieved by luck or accident, but by working on yourself daily

Three key ideas that drive me at this point are:

  1. I Can't Do This...YET
  2. The Obstacle Becomes The Way
  3. Thought Loops. Drive Out The Negative With Positive Thought Loops.
